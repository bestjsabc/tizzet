      <h2>Why sell your tickets through us?</h2>\r\n\

      </li>\r\n  <li><p>Tizzet brings the buyers to you. We market our ticket exchange to buyers that are looking for your tickets right now.

      </li>\r\n  <li><p>We deal with the buyer so you don't have to! We handle enquiries from buyers so you don't need to deal with multiple enquiries, or from buyers contacting you to try and bargain down the price of your tickets. We believe this makes the sale process much easier for our sellers.</p>\r\n\
      </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p>We guarantee you will receive your payment once your tickets have sold. We handle the receipt of money from buyers, so you don't need to give your personal details to buyers. It also helps to avoid unnecessary communication between buyers and sellers, so there is less work for you to do to get your tickets sold. If buyers have a question, we will answer it on your behalf.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\
      </ul>\r\n\
      <h2>Why buy tickets through us? Cause we're Australia's safest way to buy tickets!</h2>\r\n\

      </li>\r\n  <li><p>We don't pay sellers until after the event takes place. This ensures there is no incentive for someone to sell you fake tickets or to sell e-tickets to more than one buyer, as we won't pay them! By paying sellers after the event, we remove the incentive for someone to try and rip you off, its just one of the many ways we make Tizzet Australia'safest way to buy and sell tickets.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\

      <h2>Questions for buyers.</h2>\r\n\
      <ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>How does Tizzet work for buyers?</h3>\r\n    <p>Tizzet is a marketplace that enables you to safely buy tickets to concert, sports, theatre and other live performance events.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>What events are available on Tizzet?</h3>\r\n    <p>Fans can buy and sell tickets to any concert, festival, sport, theatre or other live entertainment. Most of our tickets are sold directly by fans, and some by event promoters through our site.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Where do these tickets come from?</h3>\r\n    <p>Tickets are put up for sale by fans that no longer need them. We all know that sometimes you need to buy tickets to events anywhere from 6 to 9 months in advance of the performance. This can make it tricky to know if you will definitely be available to attend. Got work commitments, family commitments, that cousin you don\xE2\x80\x99t really like but have to attend their wedding anyway - you get the drift!</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Does Tizzet buy and sell tickets itself?</h3>\r\n    <p>No we don't. We provide a safe and secure marketplace for fans to buy the tickets they want or no longer need.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Does Tizzet have any affiliation with ticketing agencies?</h3>\r\n    <p>No we don\xE2\x80\x99t. We've set up Tizzet for fans to sell tickets to other fans. Therefore we have a huge selection of tickets that otherwise might only be available from specific ticket agents. In the near future we will be announcing strategic partnerships with some official partners.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Why are some tickets priced above their original face value?</h3>\r\n    <p>People can sell tickets on Tizzet at any price they like, whether that be above face value, equal to face value or below face value. </p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>I want to know the exact seat numbers, how come I can't see them?</h3>\r\n    <p>For security reasons and to protect the anonymity of sellers we don\xE2\x80\x99t display the exact seat numbers, but we do show you the block and row you will be sitting in.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Will the seats I buy be seated together?</h3>\r\n    <p>Yes they will. Tickets sold on Tizzet must be seated together. If you ever have a problem, contact us and we'll fix it for you straight away or refund your money.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Who pays for postage to ship the tickets?</h3>\r\n    <p>The seller pays to send the tickets to you through Australia Post Registered Post, Express Post Platinum, or a shipping service such as DHL, FedEx, or UPS that offers tracking of shipments. These delivery methods require the buyers signature, and provides a way for Tizzet to verify that the tickets have been shipped and to track the progress of shipping. It\xE2\x80\x99s just another way that makes Tizzet Australia\xE2\x80\x99s safest and most secure way to buy and sell tickets.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>When will my tickets be delivered?</h3>\r\n    <p>Tickets will be delivered to you within 4 to 7 business days of placing your order. If you have not received your tickets please contact us at customer.service@tizzet.com.au and we will track your shipment for you.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\
      </ul>\r\n\
      <h2>Questions for sellers.</h2>\r\n\
      <ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Is there are charge for listing tickets?</h3>\r\n    <p>No. We don\xE2\x80\x99t charge you to list tickets. You are only ever charged when your tickets actually sell.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>What is Tizzet's commission and what does it cover?</h3>\r\n    <p>We charge a 5% commission when you sell your tickets. You are only charged when your tickets sell. There are no listing fees at Tizzet. Please remember that the 5% commission will be deducted from the sale of your tickets before you are paid \xE2\x80\x93 but don't worry we display this for you when you list your tickets so you can be sure of everything. For example, if you list two tickets for sale at $50 each, that's a $100 sale. We will deduct our fee of $5, and send you the remaining $95.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>How will I get paid?</h3>\r\n    <p>You can get paid through PayPal or by bank Direct Deposit. When you list your tickets we ask you how you would like to get paid.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>When will I get paid?</h3>\r\n    <p>You will get paid 7 days after the event takes place.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Why do we wait until after the event to make payment to you?</h3>\r\n    <p>We pay all of our ticket sellers after the event takes place as part of our Ticket Guarantee. This ensures that ticket buyers receive the tickets they ordered, in time for the event, and have no problems gaining access to the event. By making payment to sellers after the event we remove any incentive for sellers to attempt to list or sell fake tickets through Tizzet, as they will never get paid, and affected buyers will receive a full refund covered by our Ticket Guarantee. We are focussed on delivering Australia\xE2\x80\x99s safest way to buy and sell tickets between fans, and payment after the event makes Tizzet more secure for everyone.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Is it legal to resell tickets?</h3>\r\n    <p>Yes it is. The resale of tickets in Australia is legal. There are only two legal restrictions on the resale of tickets in Australia. In the state of Queensland, there are restrictions on the resale of tickets 10% above the face value in certain government declared venues. In Victoria, the government may ban the resale of declared major events, however this restriction typically only applies to the AFL Grand Final and other one-off international  events such as the 2006 Commonwealth Games.  We closely monitor all listings to ensure full compliance with these restrictions.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>How much should I charge for my tickets?</h3>\r\n    <p>It's up to you. At Tizzet we believe in open and transparent markets. You can sell your tickets for the same amount you paid for them, or charge more or for less than you paid for them. If there are multiple listings for your event you may want to reduce the price of your tickets to get a quicker sale. Take a look at the current listings to get an idea of the prices currently being posted in our marketplace.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Can I change the asking price of my tickets?</h3>\r\n    <p>Yes. Simply log into the My Account section at Tizzet and you can change the asking price.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>How long will my listing stay active for?</h3>\r\n    <p>There are no time limits on how long your tickets are listed for. We will remove your listing if it is within 5 weekdays of the event to ensure that there is enough time to have the tickets shipped to the buyer.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <h3>Can I list my tickets for sale on other websites at the same time?</h3>\r\n    <p>We strongly urge you not to list your tickets on any other site. Once your tickets sell you must provide them to the buyer as you have entered into a contract to provide the tickets.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n\

      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
      <p>All ticket purchases on Tizzet.com.au are covered by our Tizzet Guarantee. If an event is cancelled we will refund you the full purchase cost of your tickets. We may require you to mail the unused tickets to our offices to process your refund (you will be reimbursed these costs too).</p>
      <p>If you have not received your tickets in time for the event you need to contact us before the event takes place and we will track the shipping of your tickets. If your tickets have not reached you in time for the event we will refund the full cost of your tickets. We ensure tickets reach you in time for an event by shutting off the sale period for an event at least 7 days prior to the event, and by only using shipping that allows us to track your shipment and requires a signature upon delivery.</p>
      <p>All ticket purchases on Tizzet.com.au are final and cannot be cancelled once confirmed. Please select tickets carefully as we do not provide refunds where you may change your mind about attending an event, or where you can no longer attend on that date. In these circumstances you can sell your tickets through Tizzet.com.au.</p>
      <p>Once you order tickets, a seller has 48 hours to confirm your order. You cannot cancel an order during this 48-hour period. You can cancel an order that has remained unconfirmed for 48 hours or more, until the seller confirms the order. In the rare case that your order remains unconfirmed beyond 48 hours, please contact us by phone or email and include the order number. We'll contact the seller about the delay in confirmation. Otherwise, we'll be happy to help you cancel the order and look for comparable tickets for you!</p>

By using our Site, You agree to accept this Agreement.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Ticketing Exchange.</h3>\r\n        <p>Tizzet provides a service that allows members who want to buy tickets (\"Buyers\") to find members who want to sell tickets (\"Sellers\"). Tizzet does not take title to the underlying ticket(s) being sold. </p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Modification.</h3>\r\n        <p>If We change this Agreement, We shall post a revised version of this Agreement, which shall automatically replace the terms of this Agreement. The revised version of this Agreement is automatically effective after it is initially posted on the Site. Your continued use of the Site and the Services following Tizzet's posting of a revised Agreement will constitute Your acceptance of the revised Agreement. If You do not agree with the terms of this Agreement or any revised version of this Agreement, do not continue to use the Services or this Site.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><h2>Member Activity</h2>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Requirements.</h3>\r\n        <p>To be a member of this Site, You must agree to accept the terms in this Agreement. You may only use the Services if You can legally enter into and form binding contracts. If You do not qualify, do not use the Services.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Registration.</h3>\r\n        <p>We will not allow You to buy or sell tickets before You have registered with Us. To register, You must provide your real name, address, phone number, and email address.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Username and Password.</h3>\r\n        <p>You will need a username and password to access the Site and use the Services. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your username and password and You are responsible for any action taken under your username or password.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Listing.</h3>\r\n        <p>To sell tickets, a Seller lists the tickets in the Tizzet database. As part of the listing process, the Seller assigns a price to the tickets and provides information including but not limited to the event, date, section, seat, row, and sale end date, all in accordance with the process required as part of the listing process. You also grant to Tizzet a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, paid-up, royalty-free right and license to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish and display on the Site and on the sites of our marketing partners your descriptions of tickets listed for sale. This is so we can promote the sale of tickets and items that You list for sale.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Ownership.</h3>\r\n        <p>You represent and warrant that you own the tickets themselves, and that you are entitled to list them for sale and to sell them on our Site.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Goods and Services Tax (GST).</h3>\r\n        <p>The Seller is responsible for determining whether it/he/she is required to account for Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the sale of the ticket. Tizzet takes no responsibility for such issues. If the Seller is required to account for GST or other taxes on the sale of the ticket, the Seller should include the sales or value added tax (i.e., total) price when setting ticket prices on the website. Note that this is separate from any sales or value added tax Tizzet is required to charge on its fees. </p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Buying Tickets.</h3>\r\n        <p>A member who wants to buy a ticket first scans the Tizzet database for tickets listed by Sellers that match the Buyer's desired tickets. Once the Buyer finds a matching ticket, the Buyer purchases the tickets by clicking the \xE2\x80\x9CBuy\xE2\x80\x9D button and following the checkout procedures including providing addressing and billing information. Note that the Seller may or may not be required to charge you Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the sale of your ticket. Thus, the ticket price shown (before our fees) may include GST as appropriate. Please note this does not include any GST that may be payable on Tizzet\xE2\x80\x99s fees. As a Buyer, You grant Tizzet permission to charge your credit card or PayPal account for the purchase of the selected tickets.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Payment Authorisation.</h3>\r\n        <p>When We receive an offer by credit or debit card, We obtain an authorisation from the Buyer's credit or debit card equal to the price and fees for the tickets. We will also add GST on our fees as applicable. The authorisation will remain on the Buyer's credit or debit card until the sale is completed (when confirmed by the seller within 48 hours) or the order is cancelled. When We receive an offer by PayPal, We will obtain an authorisation from the Buyer's PayPal account equal to the price and fees for the tickets. We will also add GST on our fees as applicable. The authorisation will remain on the Buyer\xE2\x80\x99s PayPal account until the sale is completed (when confirmed by the seller within 48 hours) or the order is cancelled.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Notification.</h3>\r\n        <p>Once We obtain a successful payment authorisation from the Buyer, We notify the Seller of the sale via email and/or telephone.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Seller's Confirmation.</h3>\r\n        <p>The Seller must confirm the order within one (2) business day of sale of the tickets. Sellers should use our automated online confirmation process. </p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Shipping/Mailing Tickets.</h3>\r\n        <p>The Seller must ship the tickets within 2 business days of confirming the sale order. The Seller must allow enough time for the buyer to receive the tickets in time for the event and, in any event, must ship the tickets no later than 5 days before the event (where a ticket is sold near the shut off for listings which is 7 days prior to an event). The Seller must send the tickets by Australia Post Registered Post or Australia Post Express Platinum. This is because these postal methods require the buyer to sign for the delivery as evidence of receiving the tickets. They also feature tracking numbers which means Tizzet can verify the progress of the sellers shipment, and confirm receipt of tickets by the buyer. Sellers are not permitted to hand-over or hand deliver tickets to Buyers.</p>\r\n        <p>Collecting Payment. We collect payment from the Buyer for the listed price and booking fees. At no time do We provide the Buyer's payment information to the Seller. The money is paid to us, and the Seller is compensated for the sale according to their selected payment method. Payment is collected from the Buyer only when the order has been confirmed by the Seller.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Collecting Payment.</h3>\r\n        <p>We collect payment from the Buyer for the listed price and booking fees. At no time do We provide the Buyer's payment information to the Seller. The money is paid to us, and the Seller is compensated for the sale according to their selected payment method. Payment is collected from the Buyer only when the order has been confirmed by the Seller.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Sellers Fees.</h3>\r\n        <p>Listing tickets is free, although we do charge a fee for a successful sale of a ticket on our Site, which we call a Seller\xE2\x80\x99s Fee. The Seller\xE2\x80\x99s Fee applicable to your transaction will be set out for you to confirm when you list your tickets for sale.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Ticket Fulfillment.</h3>\r\n        <p>Once the Seller lists tickets for sale and a Buyer purchases the tickets, the Seller is responsible for completing the transaction with the exact tickets the Seller listed. The Seller may be suspended from Tizzet if they are unable to fulfil an order.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Seller Payment.</h3>\r\n        <p>The Seller will be paid 5 - 8 days after event if the delivery of the tickets was successful to the buyer. We reserve the right to withhold payment if We have a good faith basis to believe such sales were unlawful or otherwise made in material violation of this agreement.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Ticket Information.</h3>\r\n        <p>Event dates, times, venues and subject matter, which are listed on the ticket, may change. It is up to the Buyer to verify the most recent changes by contacting the box office or referring to official listings for any changes.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Substituted Seat Locations.</h3>\r\n        <p>Ticket listings are a representation of actual seat location. Tickets may be substituted with comparable or better seat locations with the Buyers' approval.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Dispute Resolution.</h3>\r\n        <p>After receiving the tickets, if a Buyer is dissatisfied with any part of the purchase the Buyer must follow the rules for dispute resolution outlined in our Tizzet Guarantee.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><h2>Your warranties to Us</h2>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Accurate Descriptions.</h3>\r\n        <p>For all tickets You list as the Seller, You warrant that Your descriptions of the tickets accurately detail and describe the tickets offered for sale.

Tizzet will cooperate to ensure that violators are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Commitment to Supply.</h3>\r\n        <p>By listing a ticket with us, you are committing to supply that ticket; which means that you are making and communicating an offer to sell that ticket. When a Buyer agrees to buy the ticket, he or she is accepting your offer, and the transaction is binding on the parties and you are required to supply a ticket to the Buyer. If, for any reason, you fail to fulfil on the contract you have entered into in respect of the sale of your ticket to the Buyer, you are liable to permanent suspension from using our services.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Making Adjustments.</h3>\r\n        <p>You authorize us to withhold payment if (a) We reasonably believe that You have committed fraud or other illegal act or omission during any buying or selling activity and are asked by any regulatory body to withhold payment or charge your payment guarantee method; (b) You are not able to produce the exact seats that you listed on the Site for a confirmed transaction; (c) You include promotional materials in the ticket shipment; or (d) You otherwise owe us a specific amount. If any of these things happen, We may also deduct from any amount We owe You the amount You owe Us.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><h2>Warranties and limitations of liability</h2>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>No Warranty.</h3>\r\n        <p>Except for the express warranties stated in this agreement, Tizzet provides the software, site and services on an \"as is\" basis and \"as available\" basis without any warranties of any kind. Tizzet makes no warranty with respect to its software, any tickets, any event, the services Tizzet provides, or that sellers or buyers will perform as promised, and Tizzet expressly disclaims all such warranties, whether express, statutory or implied, including without limitation any warranties of quality, title, non-infringement of third party rights or fitness for a particular purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusions of implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Waiver of Consequential Damages; Liability Limit.</h3>\r\n        <p>Tizzet expressly disclaims any responsibility for any lost profits or special, consequential, incidental, or exemplary damages (including without limitation indirect and special damages) that may result from the services, the site, or the suspension, termination or malfunction of the services or the site. Tizzet's liability to You or anyone else in any circumstance is limited to the lesser of (a) $100, and (b) the total value of all tickets and other items you bought and/or sold via Tizzet during the action allegedly giving rise to liability. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you. Under no circumstances is Tizzet liable for any additional costs You incur if you purchase tickets from a third party for tickets you were unable to purchase on Tizzet.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Allocation of Risk.</h3>\r\n        <p>You acknowledge and agree that the foregoing disclaimers and limitations of liability represent reasonable allocations of risk, and that the pricing and other terms and conditions of this agreement reflect such allocations of risk.</p>        \r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Release.</h3>\r\n        <p>We are not involved in the actual transactions between Buyers and Sellers. If You have a dispute with one or more members, You release Tizzet and all affiliated companies, officers, directors, agents, parents, subsidiaries, legal representatives and employees from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Tax Indemnity.</h3>\r\n        <p>You agree that Tizzet is not responsible in any way for the accuracy or suitability of any payment of taxes to any entity on your behalf. You shall indemnify and hold Tizzet and (if applicable) any parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees harmless against all liabilities, costs, interest and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Tizzet that arise out of any third party or governmental claim that involves, relates to or concerns (i) any local, regional, country, or international tax obligation or amounts due or owing under any tax regulation, law, order or decree or (ii) any dispute concerning the tax status of Tizzet.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>No Agency.</h3>\r\n        <p>You and Tizzet are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <h3>Third Party Information.</h3>\r\n        <p>We do not control the information provided by other users which is made available through the Site.
